kextlogd - A macOS kernel extension log recorder

This log recorder can be used to logging generic kernel extension and IOKit driver

Theorem:
kextlogd will spawn a /usr/bin/log process and redirect its output into a file

NOTE:
Currently supported macOS 10.12+
Due to kext cache mechanism(need verbose explanation)  /usr/bin/log itself may unstable for logging
	i.e. sometimes it log nothing even if your kext fires a log

In such case, a wordaround is to clean the kext cache:
sudo kextcache -invalidate /

TODO:
support macOS 10.11 and lower
use getopt_long(3) instead of getopt(3)
use pure C to rewrite if possible
fulfill this README
add install/uninstall targets into Makefile
